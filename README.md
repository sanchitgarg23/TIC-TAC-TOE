# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my first project where I created a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play on a 3x3 grid, with player X and player O taking turns.

## Features

- Play between two players
- Tracks game turns (X and O)
- Displays winner when the game ends
- Reset the game to start a new round

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the game
- **CSS**: For styling the game layout and board
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic and interactivity

## How to Play

1. Click on any empty box to place your mark (X or O).
2. The game will check for a winner after each move.
3. If a winner is found, a message will display the winner.
4. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset Game" button.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanchitgarg23/TIC-TAC-TOE.git
